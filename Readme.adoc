== IF Shall Not Pass

This is a simple message processing application, its +main+ method processes a list of messages. Although the list is statically generated you cannot use this to your advantage and write an implementation which would only work for the given list of messages.
Your task is to provide missing code so that the application starts to work. You can only add code as a replacement for the +// TODO: your code can be here+, modifying anything else is against the rules, you also cannot use any execution flow branching constructs like +if+ or +switch+, usage of Reflection API is not allowed either.
When you correctly complete the program and execute it you should see following output:
[listing]
.stdout
